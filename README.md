# TSP Solver using Evolutionary Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project implements an evolutionary algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the `tsplib95` library and the `berlin52` dataset. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.
